- **ChangeReturn** - The users enters a cost and the amount of money given, and this program outputs the amount of change in common bills and coins.
- **FastExponentiation** - The user enters 2 integers, a and b, and this program outputs the value a^b in O(lgn) time for n = b.
- **Fibonacci** - Finds the nth number in the Fibonacci Sequence and all n numbers in the sequence using Dynamic Programming.
- **GCD** - Finds the greatest common denominator between two integers using Euclid's Algorithm.
- **MergeSort** - A divide and conquer algorithm that sorts an integer array in increasing order in O(nlogn) time for n = array size.
- **ReverseString** - The user enters a string and this program outputs the string reversed.
