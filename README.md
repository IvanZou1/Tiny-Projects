## Classic Algorithms
- **GCD** - Finds the greatest common denominator between two integers using Euclid's Algorithm.
- **InsertionSort** - An iterative algorithm that sorts an integer array in increasing order in O(n^2) time for n = array size.
- **MergeSort** - A divide and conquer algorithm that sorts an integer array in increasing order in O(nlogn) time for n = array size.
- **QuickSort** - A divide and conquer algorithm that sorts an integer array in increasing order in expected O(nlogn) time and worst-case O(n^2) time for n = array size.

## Numbers
- **BinaryNumberConverter** - The users chooses to either convert a binary number to the decimal number system or a decimal number to a binary number, then the user enters the respective number they want to convert, and this program outputs the conversion.
- **ChangeReturn** - The users enters a cost and the amount of money given, and this program outputs the amount of change in common bills and coins.
- **CoinFlipSimulation** - The user continuously flips a fair coin until they decide to stop, and this program outputs the total number of heads and tails and its respective experimental probabilities.
- **ComplexNumberAlgebra** - The user enters 2 complex numbers (a + bi) by entering numbers a and b, and this program output the results of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, negation, and inversion of the 2 complex numbers.
- **EnglishNumerals** - The user enters a number, and this program outputs the number expressed in plain English words.
- **Euler's Number** - Find Euler's Number (e) to the nth decimal with a limit of 60 decimal places.
- **FactorialFinder** - Find the nth factorial using both loops and recursion.
- **FastExponentiation** - The user enters 2 integers, a and b, and this program outputs the value a^b in O(lgn) time for n = b using a divide and conquer algorithm.
- **Fibonacci** - Finds the nth number in the Fibonacci Sequence and all n numbers in the sequence using Dynamic Programming.
- **HappyNumbers** - Find the next five "happy numbers" given a starting number. A "happy number" is defined as a number that will eventually equal 1 when continuously replaced by the sum of the squares of each digit.
- **PI** - Find PI to the nth decimal with a limit of 60 decimal places.
- **PrimeFactorization** - Find all prime factors of an integer n in O(n).
- **PrimeNumbers** - Find all prime numbers from 0 to n.
- **SalesTaxCalculator** - The user enters a cost and then either enters the USPS abbreviation of a U.S. state (ie. NY, CA, PA, etc.) or a tax rate, and this program outputs the tax and the total cost with the tax.
- **TemperatureConverter** - The user first choose their starting temperature system and enter the temperature value. Then, this program converts the input temperature to the other two temperature systems and outputs the conversion.
- **TileCost** - The user enters the length (L) and width (W) of a floor plan and the length and cost of a single square tile, and this program outputs the total cost of tiles to fill the L by W floor and the number of tiles needed.

## Strings
- **Palindrome** - The user enters a strings and this program checks if the strings is a palindrome. That is the strings is the same forwards and backwards (ie. "kayak", "racecar", "mom").
- **ReverseString** - The user enters a strings and this program outputs the strings reversed.
- **VowelCount** - The user enters a strings and this program outputs the number of each vowel and the total number of vowels in the strings.
- **WordCount** - The user enters a strings and this program outputs the total number of words, character, and characters excluding spaces in the strings.
